Databases are one of the most important tools used by developers.  They allow us to organize, store, and retrieve data while also letting us segregate it from the rest of our application.  Because of their importance, it is imperative that you choose the right database tool for your The first choice you need to make is what type of database you need to use. There are two options. The first are SQL databases, which whie extremely powerful, can be very restrictive with how you are able to structure your data.  NoSQL databases are the second option, providing data that can be stored a large variety of ways.  This allows you to creat documents without having a defined structure and each document can be unique in structure and syntax.  NoSQL also allows you to add fields as you go without them needing to be predefined.  Another difference between these two types of databases are in how they scale.  SQL databases scale vertically. This means you can increase their capability by upgrading the single server that they run on.  NoSQL databases scale horizontally, which means you can handle more queries by adding more servers to the database.  When choosing, SQL databases will be a good option for companies looking for a solid database and benifit from the predefining of structure.  NoSQL databases will be most efficient for a user who expects there database to grow and change constantly, and therefore, need the additional flexibility NoSQL provides.  You could compare it to picking a veteran at a skill who is very well trained in the specific thing he was taught but does not pick up new skills well, or hiring a rookie employee who is very flexible at picking up skills and doing whatever you need without being exceptional in a single skill set.
